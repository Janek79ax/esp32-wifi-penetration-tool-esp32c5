# Czech5
This project implements active broadcast deauth frames on selected targets on ESP32 C5. 
Based on https://github.com/risinek/esp32-wifi-penetration-tool

# Features 
 - Up to 10 APs can be attacked with channel switching, just select them on the web page
 - Deauth frame has been fixed so now Active DOS attack works
 - On the other hand, passive and mixed attack mode and handshake and PMKID attacks have been disabled
